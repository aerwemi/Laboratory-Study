# Laboratory-Study
Training Data Set

study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. We Analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Data Summary:
clinicaltrial_data.csv file with 'Mouse ID'	'Timepoint'	'Tumor Volume (mm3)'	'Metastatic Sites' cls.
mouse_drug_data.csv file with 'Mouse ID' and 'Drug' used for the treatment cls.   


Work Summary:
Show how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
Show how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
Shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
Compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.



Summary:

Data shows the best performing treatment is Capomulin. 
Every Mouse treated with Capomulin showed decreased Tumor volume over the duration of the study 

Metastatic Spread During Treatment - positive for all treatments â€“ Capomulin with the gentlest trend 
The best survival rate observed for those treated with  
The study overall shows decrease of Tumor size by ~19% for the  Capomulin while all other treatments showed increase of Tumor size of about ~50%
